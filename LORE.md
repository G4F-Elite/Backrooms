## The Mythos

### What Are The Backrooms?

The Backrooms exist as a vast, seemingly infinite dimension that exists parallel to our reality. They are the spaces behind reality - the empty rooms, forgotten corridors, and impossible architecture that shouldn't exist but somehow does.

**How to Enter:**
- "No-clipping" through reality in areas where the fabric of existence is thin
- Walking through certain doorways at specific times
- Severe trauma or near-death experiences
- Simply being in the wrong place at the wrong moment

**The Nature of the Space:**
The Backrooms are not built - they *are*. They represent the subconscious architecture of human memory - every office you've forgotten, every hallway you walked through without noticing, every room that felt "off" but you couldn't explain why. These spaces collect, merge, and grow in the Backrooms.

### The Hum

A constant, oppressive 60Hz electrical hum permeates Level 0. This is not random - it's the frequency at which human consciousness begins to break down. Long exposure causes:
- Memory fragmentation
- Time distortion perception
- Reality questioning
- Eventually, complete dissolution of identity

## Story & Narrative

### The Protagonist

**Name:** Unknown (memories fragmented)
**Background:** Office worker who stayed late one night

**The Last Normal Memory:**
*"I remember walking to the break room. The fluorescent light was flickering - I'd reported it weeks ago. I blinked, and the hallway was longer than before. The door to the break room wasn't there anymore. When I turned around, neither was my office. Just... yellow. Endless yellow."*

### Story Progression

**Phase 1: Confusion (0-60 seconds)**
- Player spawns in a relatively "safe" area near lights
- Audio cues establish the oppressive atmosphere
- The horror is subtle - just the wrongness of infinite identical rooms

**Phase 2: Awareness (1-3 minutes)**
- First entity sighting (distant)
- Player realizes they are not alone
- Sanity begins to matter as sounds grow louder

**Phase 3: Pursuit (3-5 minutes)**
- Multiple entities become active
- The environment begins to "reshuffle" - walls move when unobserved
- True survival horror begins

**Phase 4: Desperation (5+ minutes)**
- Sanity critically low
- Hallucinations mix with real threats
- Every shadow could be death

### The Truth (Hidden Lore)

The entities were once people like you. Those who lose all sanity don't die - they *transform*. The Stalker moves slowly because it remembers being human. The Shadow hides because it's ashamed of what it became. The Crawler forgot everything except the need to find others.

**There is no escape.** The Backrooms extend infinitely. Your goal is not to escape - it's to survive as long as possible before you become one of them.

## Level 0 - The Lobby

### Environmental Description

Level 0, known as "The Lobby," is the most well-documented level of the Backrooms. Its characteristics are consistent yet endless:

**Physical Properties:**
- Ceiling height: 4.5 meters
- Cell size: 5x5 meters
- Wall material: Aged yellow wallpaper over deteriorating drywall
- Floor: Damp, mono-yellow carpet (never dries, slightly sticky)
- Ceiling: Acoustic panels with recessed fluorescent lighting

**Atmospheric Conditions:**
- Temperature: Constant 24°C (75°F)
- Humidity: 85-90%
- Lighting: Harsh, inconsistent fluorescent (20% failure rate)
- Sound: 60Hz hum, occasional distant noises

### The Geometry

The maze of Level 0 follows impossible rules:
- Corridors loop back impossibly
- Rooms change when unobserved
- Distance is inconsistent - 100 meters can feel like 10 or 1000
- Landmarks shift position

### Points of Interest

**Light Clusters:** Areas with multiple working lights are safer
**Dark Zones:** Lights that have failed - entities prefer these
**Pillars:** Structural columns that never move - rare fixed points
**The Void Spots:** Extremely dark areas - avoid at all costs

## Entities

### Entity #1: The Stalker

**Designation:** E-01
**Threat Level:** Moderate
**Behavior:** Passive-Aggressive

**Description:**
A tall, gaunt humanoid figure. Its proportions are wrong - arms too long, legs bent at odd angles. It wears what appears to be tattered business attire, suggesting it was once an office worker who got lost.

**Behavior Pattern:**
- Follows players who aren't looking at it
- Freezes when observed
- Slowly backs away if stared at for 3+ seconds
- Will attack if it gets close enough while unobserved

**Origin Theory:**
The Stalker was someone who spent months wandering Level 0. The loneliness drove them mad, but some part of them still remembers human social anxiety - the fear of being watched. Now it can only move when no one is looking, forever seeking the human connection it craves but can never have.

**Survival Tips:**
- Keep it in your peripheral vision
- Don't run - it triggers chase instinct
- Stare it down if it gets too close

---

### Entity #2: The Crawler

**Designation:** E-02
**Threat Level:** High
**Behavior:** Aggressive

**Description:**
A twisted form that moves on all fours. Its body is contorted in ways that suggest broken bones that healed wrong. It skitters across the floor with terrifying speed, pressing itself against the carpet as if trying to become one with the floor.

**Behavior Pattern:**
- Attracted to sound (especially running footsteps)
- Extremely fast in straight corridors
- Poor at cornering
- Gives up chase after losing line of sight for 10+ seconds

**Origin Theory:**
The Crawler was someone who tried to escape by moving as fast as possible. They ran until their body broke. They crawled until their mind broke. Now running is all they know - an endless, desperate sprint toward something they can't remember.

**Survival Tips:**
- Don't sprint unless necessary
- Use corners to break line of sight
- Crouch to minimize sound
- It cannot climb pillars

### Entity #3: The Shadow

**Designation:** E-03
**Threat Level:** Extreme
**Behavior:** Ambush Predator

**Description:**
Almost impossible to see directly. The Shadow appears as a darkness that's darker than the surrounding area - a void in humanoid shape. Looking directly at it makes it fade from view. It can only be seen in peripheral vision.

**Behavior Pattern:**
- Invisible when looked at directly
- Approaches from behind or sides
- Causes rapid sanity drain when nearby
- Attacks only when very close and unobserved

**Origin Theory:**
The Shadow was someone who tried to hide from the other entities. They hid in the darkest corners, in the spaces between lights. They became so good at hiding that they became the darkness itself. Now they hunt others the way they were once hunted - from the shadows, unseen.

**Survival Tips:**
- Trust your peripheral vision
- If you feel watched, you probably are
- Keep your back to walls when possible
- Light offers partial protection

| Crouch | 2.0 m/s | Very Low | None |

### Environmental Mechanics

#### The Reshuffle
The Backrooms are alive in a sense - they change when unobserved. Every 15-30 seconds, walls behind the player may shift:
- Creates new paths
- Closes old ones
- Ensures player can never retrace steps exactly
- Makes mapping impossible

#### Light States
- **On (80%):** Safe, full visibility
- **Flickering:** Entity nearby
- **Off (20%):** Dangerous, reduced visibility

#### Dynamic Spawning
- Entities spawn outside player view
- Maximum 3 active entities
- Spawn rate increases with survival time
- New entity every 45-75 seconds

## Survival Guide

### Beginner Tips

1. **Stay Near Lights** - Entities prefer darkness
2. **Keep Moving** - Standing still increases danger
3. **Watch Your Sanity** - Mental state affects perception
4. **Listen Carefully** - Audio cues warn of threats
5. **Don't Run Blindly** - Sprint attracts Crawlers

### Advanced Strategies

1. **Corner Checking** - Always look around corners slowly

## The Final Truth

*"I've been here for... I don't know how long anymore. Days? Weeks? The lights never change. The hum never stops. I found a note once, written in handwriting that looked like mine. It said 'Don't trust yourself.' I don't remember writing it.*

*The worst part isn't the things that chase you. It's realizing that the walls moved while you blinked. It's hearing footsteps that match yours, one step behind. It's looking at your hands and not being sure they're yours anymore.*

*I think I understand now. The Backrooms aren't a place you escape from. They're a place you become part of. Every entity I've seen... they were all someone once. Someone who stayed too long. Someone who gave up.*

*I won't give up. Not yet. Not while I can still remember my name.*

*...what was my name?"*
